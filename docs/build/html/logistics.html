<h2>Lab Organization<a class="headerlink" href="#lab-organization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Lab tutorials and assignments will be posted on the website before each lab starts.
During lab sessions, you can work on these materials at your own pace,
and let TAs know if you have any questions.</li>
<li>It is encouraged to go over lab materials before coming to the lab, such that you can
wisely/efficiently use the time during lab sessions and ask important questions to help you
finish (or at least figure out how to finish) the lab assignment by the end of the lab.</li>
<li>Meanwhile, the TAs will maintain two lists on the whiteboard, one for demo and the other for help.
Please put your name on the corresponding list when needed.
The TAs will take care of two lists alternately.
It is good to organize things in this way because<ul>
<li>It is good for TAs to remember your name.</li>
<li>It is fair for all students to get help on a first come first served basis.</li>
<li>TAs may not be available right at the time you raise up your hand
(e.g., may be working on fixing a bug that a previous student just pointed out).</li>

<div class="section" id="submission-and-grading">
<h2>Submission and Grading<a class="headerlink" href="#submission-and-grading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>For some labs, it is required to submit your code via Canvas or Gradescope.
Please organize your code clearly and explain it by adding proper comments.
Please also submit a lab report to document your approach.
A template lab report will be provided.</li>
<li>For some other labs, it is required to demo.
During the demo, some questions may be asked to test your understanding
of lab materials. Sample questions may be given in lab assignments.
Please get prepared, otherwise you may lose points.</li>
<li>Attendance is required for all labs. However,
you may leave early if you have completed all lab materials.
<strong>Please sign in and sign out when you enter/leave the lab room.</strong>
(There is a sign-in form near the door.)
This lab rule is enforced by the department.</li>
<li>Lab assignments are typically due at 11:59pm one week after assigned, unless otherwise specified.

<h2>Communications<a class="headerlink" href="#communications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Please consider reaching out to TAs in the following preferred order, regarding technical issues.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Office Hour</strong>. Please wisely use the time at office hour, during which
TAs can give detailed explanations.
You can also email TAs to schedule an appointment, if you cannot make it to office hour.</li>
<li><strong>Canvas</strong>. If you have any questions/concerns offline, please ask on Canvas (Piazza section) first.<ul>
<li>It is good for others who have the same/similar questions.</li>
<li>We can use multimedia materials to interact on Canvas (Piazza section), rather than plain text in emails.</li>
<li>You may get good answers/help from your classmates as well, which is encouraged.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><strong>Emails</strong>. It is hard to discuss technical questions through emails.
However, TAs will try to get back to you ASAP. To facilitate the process,
please have <strong>EE144_HW/Lab</strong> in the email subject.<ul>
<li>For course logistics and technical questions, Piazza is better than emails.</li>
<li>For other queries (e.g., personal affairs), you are very welcome to send TAs an email.</li>
